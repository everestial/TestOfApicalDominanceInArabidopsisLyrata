# Analyses of data from auxin inhibition assays

This is the Project (03) of my PhD. This project contains data obtained from auxin inhibition experiment performed on *A. lyrata*.
There were two treatment groups (Auxin treated and Control) which were futher subdivided into two futher sub-treatment group. Data was recorded as photo of each plant taken from top with a scale and it's ID on the side.
The photos were recored weekly but at time biweekly due to inconvenience. 
The trait measurements are included in folder **data/"** as excel file for different months. All the analyses (plotting and statistical) is done in **`R`**. The script file is available as file [AllAnalysis.Rmd](experiment02/AllAnalysis.Rmd)
