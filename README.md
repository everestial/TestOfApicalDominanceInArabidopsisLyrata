# Analyses of data from auxin inhibition assays

This is the Project (03) of my PhD. This project contains data obtained from auxin inhibition experiment performed on *A. lyrata*. There were two treatment groups (Auxin treated and Control) which were futher subdivided into two futher sub-treatment group.

Data was recorded as photo of each plant taken from top with a scale and it's ID on the side. The photos were recored weekly but at time biweekly due to inconvenience. The trait measurements are included in folder **"/TraitData/"** as excel file for different months. All the analyses (plotting and statistical) is done in **`R`**. The script file is available as file **"AlyAuxinTreatmentDataAnalyses.R"**. 

**The "Rmarkdown" of the the analyses is available as HTML output in this link:** https://rawgit.com/everestial/AuxinInhibitionResultsDataAnalyses/master/AlyAuxinTreatmentDataAnalyses.html
